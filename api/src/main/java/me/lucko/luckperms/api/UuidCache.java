/**
 * A UUID cache for online users, between external Mojang UUIDs, and internal LuckPerms UUIDs.
 *
 * <p>This UuidCache is a means of allowing users to have the same internal UUID across a network of offline mode
 * servers or mixed offline mode and online mode servers. Platforms running in offline mode generate a UUID for a
 * user when they first join the server, but this UUID will then not be consistent across the network. LuckPerms will
 * instead check the datastore cache, to get a UUID for a user that is consistent across an entire network.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you want to get a user object from the Storage using the api on a server in offline mode, you will need to use
 * this cache, OR use Storage#getUUID, for users that are not online.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>This is only effective for online players. Use {@link Storage#getUUID(String)} for offline players.</strong></p>
