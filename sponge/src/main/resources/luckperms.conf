# |                         Default Assignments                            | #
# +------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #

# This section allows you to define defaults to give users whenever they connect to the server.
# The default assignments are highly configurable and conditional.
#
# There is one default assignment built into LuckPerms, which will add all users to the "default" group if they
# are not a member of any other group. This setting cannot be disabled. However, you can use this section to add more of
# your own.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# In order to save storage space, LuckPerms does not store users who have no permissions defined, and are only a member
# of the default group. Adding default assignments to this section will negate this effect. It is HIGHLY RECCOMENDED
# that instead of assigning defaults here, you add permissions to the "default" group, or set the "default" group to inherit
# other groups, and then use the group-name-rewrite rule above.
#
# It is also important to note that these rules are considered every time a player logs into the server, and are applied
# directly to the user's data. Simply removing a rule here will not reserse the effect of that rule on any users who have
# already had it applied to them.
#
# The "has" and "lacks" conditions below support standard boolean logic, using the 'and' & 'or' characters used in Java.
# e.g. "(some.other.permission | some.permission.other) & some.thing.else" == a user has 'some.other.permission', or
# 'some.permission.other', and they also have 'some.thing.else'
#
# Groups are represented by the permission node: group.<group name>
# Per server and per world nodes are represented by: "server-world/permission" or "server/permission"
#
# Within conditions, permission nodes MUST be escaped using "<" and ">". See the example below.
#
# Explaination of the examples below: (they're just to demonstrate the features & use cases)
#
# rule1:
# If a user is either in the vip or vip+ group, and they have the "titles.titlecollector" permission set to true, and the
# "some.random.permission" set to false... if they're not in the group "prison_titlepack" on the "prison" server, then
# give add them to the "prison_titlepack" group on the "prison" server, and remove "some.random.permission".
#
# rule2:
# If the user isn't in any of the following groups on the skyblock server: sb_level1, sb_level2, sb_level3, then add
# them to sb_level1 on the skyblock server.
#
# rule3:
# If the user is a member of the default group, remove them from default, add them to member, and set their primary group
# to member.
#
# WARNING: Unlike internal commands, this system does not ensure that a group exists before adding a user to it.
# It also does not unsure that a user is a member of a group before making that group their primary group.
#
# Before you use "give: group.<name>" or "set-primary-group", make sure that the group exists, and that the user is
# a member of the group.
