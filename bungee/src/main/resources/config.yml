# How the plugin should store data
#
# - The various options are explained in more detail on the wiki:
#   https://luckperms.net/wiki/Storage-types
#
# - Possible options:
#
#   |  Remote databases - require connection information to be configured below
#   |=> MySQL
#   |=> MariaDB (preferred over MySQL)
#   |=> PostgreSQL
#   |=> MongoDB
#
#   |  Flatfile/local database - don't require any extra configuration
#   |=> H2 (preferred over SQLite)
#   |=> SQLite
#
#   |  Readable & editable text files - don't require any extra configuration
#   |=> YAML (.yml files)
#   |=> JSON (.json files)
#   |=> HOCON (.conf files)
#   |=> TOML (.toml files)
#   |
#   | By default, user, group and track data is separated into different files. Data can be combined
#   | and all stored in the same file by switching to a combined storage variant.
#   | Just add '-combined' to the end of the storage-method, e.g. 'yaml-combined'
#
# - A H2 database is the default option.
# - If you want to edit data manually in "traditional" storage files, we suggest using YAML.
storage-method: h2

# The following block defines the settings for remote database storage methods.
#
# - You don't need to touch any of the settings here if you're using a local storage method!
# - The connection detail options are shared between all remote storage types.
data:

  # Define the address and port for the database.
  # - The standard DB engine port is used by default
  #   (MySQL: 3306, PostgreSQL: 5432, MongoDB: 27017)
  # - Specify as "host:port" if differs
  address: localhost

  # The name of the database to store LuckPerms data in.
  # - This must be created already. Don't worry about this setting if you're using MongoDB.
  database: minecraft

  # Credentials for the database.
  username: root
  password: ''

  # These settings apply to the MySQL connection pool.
  # - The default values will be suitable for the majority of users.
  # - Do not change these settings unless you know what you're doing!
  pool-settings:

    # Sets the maximum size of the MySQL connection pool.
    # - Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual
    #   connections to the database backend.
    # - More information about determining the size of connection pools can be found here:
    #   https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing
    maximum-pool-size: 10

    # Sets the minimum number of idle connections that the pool will try to maintain.
    # - For maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, it is recommended to not set
    #   this value and instead allow the pool to act as a fixed size connection pool.
    #   (set this value to the same as 'maximum-pool-size')
    minimum-idle: 10

    # This setting controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool in milliseconds.
    # - The value should be at least 30 seconds less than any database or infrastructure imposed
    #   connection time limit.
    maximum-lifetime: 1800000 # 30 minutes

    # This setting controls how frequently the pool will 'ping' a connection in order to prevent it
    # from being timed out by the database or network infrastructure, measured in milliseconds.
    # - The value should be less than maximum-lifetime and greater than 30000 (30 seconds).
    # - Setting the value to zero will disable the keepalive functionality.
    keepalive-time: 0

    # This setting controls the maximum number of milliseconds that the plugin will wait for a
    # connection from the pool, before timing out.
    connection-timeout: 5000 # 5 seconds

    # This setting allows you to define extra properties for connections.
    #
    # By default, the following options are set to enable utf8 encoding. (you may need to remove
    # these if you are using PostgreSQL)
    #   useUnicode: true
    #   characterEncoding: utf8
    #
    # You can also use this section to disable SSL connections, by uncommenting the 'useSSL' and
    # 'verifyServerCertificate' options below.
    properties:
      useUnicode: true
      characterEncoding: utf8
      #useSSL: false
      #verifyServerCertificate: false

  # The prefix for all LuckPerms SQL tables.
  #
  # - This only applies for remote SQL storage types (MySQL, MariaDB, etc).
  # - Change this if you want to use different tables for different servers.
  table-prefix: 'luckperms_'

  # The prefix to use for all LuckPerms MongoDB collections.
  #
  # - This only applies for the MongoDB storage type.
  # - Change this if you want to use different collections for different servers. The default is no
  # prefix.
  mongodb-collection-prefix: ''

  # The connection string URI to use to connect to the MongoDB instance.
  #
  # - When configured, this setting will override anything defined in the address, database,
  #   username or password fields above.
  # - If you have a connection string that starts with 'mongodb://' or 'mongodb+srv://', enter it
  #   below.
  # - For more information, please see https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/
  mongodb-connection-uri: ''

# Define settings for a "split" storage setup.
#
# - This allows you to define a storage method for each type of data.
# - The connection options above still have to be correct for each type here.
split-storage:
  # Don't touch this if you don't want to use split storage!
  enabled: false
  methods:
    # These options don't need to be modified if split storage isn't enabled.
    user: h2
    group: h2
    track: h2
    uuid: h2

# +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ #

# This option controls how frequently LuckPerms will perform a sync task.
#
# - A sync task will refresh all data from the storage, and ensure that the most up-to-date data is
#   being used by the plugin.
# - This is disabled by default, as most users will not need it. However, if you're using a remote
#   storage type without a messaging service setup, you may wish to set this to something like 3.
# - Set to -1 to disable the task completely.
sync-minutes: -1

# If the file watcher should be enabled.
#
# - When using a file-based storage type, LuckPerms can monitor the data files for changes, and
#   automatically update when changes are detected.
# - If you don't want this feature to be active, set this option to false.
watch-files: true

# Define which messaging service should be used by the plugin.
#
# - If enabled and configured, LuckPerms will use the messaging service to inform other connected
#   servers of changes.
# - Use the command "/lp networksync" to manually push changes.
# - Data is NOT stored using this service. It is only used as a messaging platform.
#
# - If you decide to enable this feature, you should set "sync-minutes" to -1, as there is no need
#   for LuckPerms to poll the database for changes.
#
# - Possible options:
#   => sql           Uses the SQL database to form a queue system for communication. Will only work
#                    when 'storage-method' is set to MySQL or MariaDB. This is chosen by default if
#                    the option is set to 'auto' and SQL storage is in use. Set to 'notsql' to
#                    disable this.
#   => pluginmsg     Uses the plugin messaging channels to communicate with the proxy.
#                    LuckPerms must be installed on your proxy & all connected servers backend
#                    servers. Won't work if you have more than one BungeeCord proxy.
#   => redis         Uses Redis pub-sub to push changes. Your server connection info must be
#                    configured below.
#   => redisbungee   Uses Redis pub-sub to push changes, using the RedisBungee API. You need to have
#                    the RedisBungee plugin installed.
#   => rabbitmq      Uses RabbitMQ pub-sub to push changes. Your server connection info must be
#                    configured below.
#   => custom        Uses a messaging service provided using the LuckPerms API.
#   => auto          Attempts to automatically setup a messaging service using redis or sql.
messaging-service: auto

# If LuckPerms should automatically push updates after a change has been made with a command.
auto-push-updates: true

# If LuckPerms should push logging entries to connected servers via the messaging service.
push-log-entries: true

# If LuckPerms should broadcast received logging entries to players on this platform.
#
# - If you have LuckPerms installed on your backend servers as well as a BungeeCord proxy, you
#   should set this option to false on either your backends or your proxies, to avoid players being
#   messaged twice about log entries.

# If LuckPerms should ensure all players have permission data when they connect to the server.
#
# - When set to true, LuckPerms will cancel login attempts if it is unable to load permissions data
#   for a user, or if the storage provider is unavailable.
# - When set to false, LuckPerms will allow a player to connect regardless of whether their
#   permissions data could be loaded.
# - This option does not exist on other platforms, and effectively defaults to true - however,
#   the option is provided on BungeeCord, as it is less likely to be so dependant on permissions.
cancel-failed-logins: false

# Controls how temporary permissions/parents/meta should be accumulated.
#
# - The default behaviour is "deny".
# - This behaviour can also be specified when the command is executed. See the command usage
#   documentation for more info.
#
# - Possible options:
#   => accumulate   durations will be added to the existing expiry time
#   => replace      durations will be replaced if the new duration is later than the current
#                   expiration
#   => deny         the command will just fail if you try to add another node with the same expiry
temporary-add-behaviour: deny

# Controls how LuckPerms will determine a users "primary" group.
#
# - The meaning and influence of "primary groups" are explained in detail on the wiki.
# - The preferred approach is to let LuckPerms automatically determine a users primary group
#   based on the relative weight of their parent groups.
#
# - Possible options:
#   => stored                  use the value stored against the users record in the file/database
#   => parents-by-weight       just use the users most highly weighted parent
#   => all-parents-by-weight   same as above, but calculates based upon all parents inherited from
#                              both directly and indirectly
primary-group-calculation: parents-by-weight

# If the plugin should check for "extra" permissions with users run LP commands.
#
# - These extra permissions allow finer control over what users can do with each command, and who
#   they have access to edit.
# - The nature of the checks are documented on the wiki under "Argument based command permissions".
# - Argument based permissions are *not* static, unlike the 'base' permissions, and will depend upon
#   the arguments given within the command.
argument-based-command-permissions: false

# If the plugin should check whether senders are a member of a given group before they're able to

# Note: these limitations do not apply to the web editor!
require-sender-group-membership-to-modify: false

# If the plugin should send log notifications to users whenever permissions are modified.
#
# - Notifications are only sent to those with the appropriate permission to receive them
# - They can also be temporarily enabled/disabled on a per-user basis using
#   '/lp log notify <on|off>'
log-notify: true

# Defines a list of log entries which should not be sent as notifications to users.

auto-install-translations: true

# Defines the options for prefix and suffix stacking.
#
# - The feature allows you to display multiple prefixes or suffixes alongside a players username in
#   chat.
# - It is explained and documented in more detail on the wiki under "Prefix & Suffix Stacking".
#
# - The options are divided into separate sections for prefixes and suffixes.
# - The 'duplicates' setting refers to how duplicate elements are handled. Can be 'retain-all',
#   'first-only' or 'last-only'.
# - The value of 'start-spacer' is included at the start of the resultant prefix/suffix.
# - The value of 'end-spacer' is included at the end of the resultant prefix/suffix.
# - The value of 'middle-spacer' is included between each element in the resultant prefix/suffix.
#
# - Possible format options:

#   => lowest                         Same as above, except takes the one with the lowest weight.
#
#   => highest_own                    Selects the value with the highest weight, but will not
#                                     accept any inherited values.

#                                     accept inherited values.
#
#   => lowest_inherited               Same as above, except takes the value with the lowest weight.
#
#   => highest_on_track_<track>       Selects the value with the highest weight, but only if the
#                                     value was inherited from a group on the given track.
#
#   => lowest_on_track_<track>        Same as above, except takes the value with the lowest weight.
#
#   => highest_not_on_track_<track>   Selects the value with the highest weight, but only if the
#                                     value was inherited from a group not on the given track.
#
#   => lowest_not_on_track_<track>    Same as above, except takes the value with the lowest weight.
#
#   => highest_from_group_<group>     Selects the value with the highest weight, but only if the
#                                     value was inherited from the given group.
#
#   => lowest_from_group_<group>      Same as above, except takes the value with the lowest weight.
#

# If a final sort according to "inheritance rules" should be performed after the traversal algorithm
# has resolved the inheritance tree.
#
# "Inheritance rules" refers to things such as group weightings, primary group status, and the
# natural contextual ordering of the group nodes.
#
# Setting this to 'true' will allow for the inheritance rules to take priority over the structure of
# the inheritance tree.
#
# Effectively when this setting is 'true': the tree is flattened, and rules applied afterwards,
# and when this setting is 'false':, the rules are just applied during each step of the traversal.

#   => all-values-per-key           Set A will be satisfied by another set B, if all key-value
