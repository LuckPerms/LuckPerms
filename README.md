LuckPerms is an advanced permissions implementation aiming to be a fast, reliable and flexible alternative to existing permission plugins. The project's main goals are centered around high performance and a wide feature set, filling the gaps of functionality and building upon existing features found in other plugins.

LuckPerms also includes an extensive API for developers, and support for a variety of Minecraft server software & data storage options.

## Contributing
#### Pull Requests

LuckPerms loosely follows the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Generally, try to copy the style of code found in the class you're editing. 

#### Project Layout
The project is split up into a few separate modules.

* **API** - The public, semantically versioned API used by other plugins wishing to integrate with and retrieve data from LuckPerms. This module (for the most part) does not contain any implementation itself, and is provided by the plugin.
* **Common** - The common module contains most of the code which implements the respective LuckPerms plugins. This abstract module reduces duplicated code throughout the project.
* **Bukkit, BungeeCord, Sponge, Nukkit & Velocity** - Each use the common module to implement plugins on the respective server platforms.
